1.0 Applicable Products


This document contains the technical information needed to connect Harman Kardon AVR
series receivers equipped with bi-direction RS-232 control capability to a computer or other
compatible specialized control devices with RS-232 communications capability for control
and feedback of the receiver. The current Harman Kardon products with this capability are
the AVR 635, AVR 630, AVR 435 and AVR 430.

The remote codes listed in this document may be used to control any Harman Kardon AVR
or DPR model product equipped with and RS-232 port, but only the models listed above
allow for two-way communication. All other products are one-way only.

2.0 Control Capabilities


Applicable Harman Kardon’s AVR products listed above are designed for operation in
conjunction with remote keypad, computer or other control devices capable of sending
compatible hexadecimal data through an RS-232 connection. The commands issued by
the computer or control system will mimic the operation of the standard remote control,
and the AVR will respond accordingly. This document describes the connections between
the devices and their interaction.

The control data is sent from the PC or control device to the AVR using commands issued
using either a PC Keyboard or Mouse or a touch screen controller and data from the AVR
with its status may be displayed on the PC or interpreted for touch screen display.

3.0 Connections and Settings


3.1 Connections

The connection between the computer and the AVR is via a two-wire connection using
standard DB-9 connections.

The connections should be made directly (“straight through”) from pin 3 (TxD) to pin 3, and
from pin 5 (GND) to pin 5. No other connections are needed, although a standard serial
connection cable with all pins connected may be used.

IMORTANT NOTE: It is essential that a standard “straight through” connection cable
be used. DO NOT use a “null modem” cable. Since the AVR cross over the pin
connections internally, the use of null modem cable will render RS-232 control
system inoperable.

3.2 RS-232 Settings

The following settings should be made on PC or control device:

Baud Rate: 38,400 bps
Data Bits: 8
Parity: No
Stop Bit: 1
Flow Control: No (off)
Command Acceptance Time: 50 ms

4.0 Data Communication Format

4.1. Transmission

Transmission        Data Type     Length        Information Field         Check Sum

Transmission recognition code is 6 bytes long ASCII code and it is used to make a
distinction between AVR Control Data being sent from PC to AVR or AVR status Data
coming from AVR to be displayed on PC. Following codes are used for this purpose:

“PCSEND”(ASCII) AVR Control Data (PC to AVR) using PC Keyboard or Mouse
“MPSEND”(ASCII) Data for AVR Status Display on PC (AVR to PC)

4.2 Data Type


Transmission      Data Type      Length        Information Field         Check Sum

Data Type field is a one byte long and distinguishes between different types of data being
used in protocol as explained in the following table:

      Purpose                         Direction                          Value

4.3 Data Length


Transmission      Data Type      Length        Information Field         Check Sum

Length field is one byte long and represents length of information field. As information field
is variable depending on direction of data transfer, this field is necessary. Length field
value will be 4 if Remote Control through PC to AVR is used and the value will be 48 if
AVR status display on PC is desired.

4.4 Information Field


Transmission      Data Type      Length        Information Field         Check Sum

Information field is hex code data of either four-byte command from PC to AVR or 48-byte
hex code for AVR status display on PC. We explain both of them in detail in the following
sections:

4.4.1 Information Field Command Sequences

4.4.1.1 Command Transmission Sequence from PC to AVR

Each command consists of a four-byte hex code from the table at the end of this
document. To send a command, first find the hex code listed in the chart for the specific
function. Convert each byte to binary, and then precede each byte with a start bit (0) and
follow it with a stop bit (1). Make certain that the time for the transmission of all four bytes
does not exceed 50 ms; the AVR will interpret a time gap greater than 50 ms as the start of
a new command.

For example, to send the “80, 70, C1, 3E” hex code sequence to issue a “Mute” command,
the sequence would be as follows, including the start and stop bit after each hex code:




                              TOTAL STRUTCTURE FOR THE
                                FOUR_BYTE COMMAND

When building a sequence with multiple commands, remember to insert a sufficient time
delay so that the total time from the start of one four-byte command to the start of next four
byte command is at least 50 ms.

The protocol for code transmission does not allow for “repeat” or continuous code. Thus,
for commands (such as “Volume”) for which the button would be held down when using the
actual remote, the specific command (e. g., “Volume Up” or “Volume Down”) must be sent
individually as many times as necessary to achieve the desired effect.

The commands being sent through the RS-232 link are direct mirror images of the
commands and command sequences that would be used if you were pressing the remote
control buttons. In cases where a main command is issued first, followed by up/down or
left/right navigation to select a choice, you will need to use the specific directional
command codes for the command in use. The up/down and left/right navigation commands
are NOT universal for RS-232 link; it is crucial that you use the correct navigation
command control.

The following diagram shows the detail of data being sent from AVR to PC to show status
to be displayed:




4.5: Check Sums

Transmission      Data Type     Length        Information Field         Check Sum

Check sum is calculated by splitting the data into even bytes and odd bytes and calculating
two checksum bytes using them. Check sum high byte is calculated by Xor sum of even
bytes while check sum low byte is calculated by Xor sum of odd bytes.

          Data[0]^Data[2]^…..Data[2n]= Check Sum[0]   high byte
          Data[1]^Data[3]^…..Data[2n-1]= Check Sum[1]    low byte

5.0 Constructing Command Sequences

To construct command set sequences for RS-232 control, you must create a structure that
duplicates the button that you would push on remote control to issue the desired
command.

Some commands require multiple button presses, regardless of whether the command is
being sent from remote, or via RS-232 link. You should make sure that all needed
commands for desired functionality is included and the spacing between each commands
is at least 50 ms.

The command structure for RS-232 link does not accommodate “repeat” commands.
These must be issued by duplicating commands as many times as needed.

In constructing commands for Surround Select, Multi-room, Speaker Configuration, Digital
Input and Delay, the direct access setup controls for these options require that you should
first send the code that accesses the control sequence. To adjust the settings or scroll
through the menus, you must then issue the specific “Up” or “Down” commands that are
associated with the item being controlled.

For example, when changing the surround mode using the Dolby, DTS Surround, DTS
Neo:6, Logic 7 or Stereo commands, note that first command selects the mode and the
next command should select the mode choices.


6.0 Procedures for Switching AVR and PC Modes

In case of AVR Normal Mode and PC Remote Control (REMOCON), normal protocol
procedures as mentioned already will be applied. The following sections explain the other
switching modes.

6.1 Switching from PC REMOCON Mode to PC CPU Writing Mode

Step 1: User selects CPU button at the screen box of PC REMOCON. As a result, PC
sends the following command:

Command: "PCSEND" + 0x04 + 0x02 + 0x00 + 0x00 + 0x00 + 0x00
Response: No response comes from AVR

Step 2: After receiving the command from step 1, AVR will switch from normal mode to
AVR CPU writing mode and will stop sending its status information.

Step 3: User clicks the open button at the screen box of PC CPU Writing. User selects and
loads CPU HEX DATA (This HEX file has Intel-HEX format) using explorer box.

                                           Page 7 of 12
Step 4: User clicks the Start button at the screen box of PC CPU Writing. This step
creates the following protocol behind the scene:

   a) Check Connection – Following command is used to check connection:

       Command: 0x08 + Sync Data (0x00) X 16 + CRC (2bytes)
       Response: 0x08 + CRC (2bytes)

      Check CRC to make sure the message reached correctly. We have already
   discussed CRC calculation method.

   b) Erase Earlier Settings – Unless response is OK, continue to send this command:
      Command: 0x01 + CRC (2bytes)
      Response: if OK, 0x01 + CRC (2bytes)
                  if Error, 0x0e + CRC (2bytes)
   c) Program CPU - Follow sending the required command, the command is sent
                 again till correct response is received:
                    Command: 0x03 + address (3bytes: Low, Mid, High byte in order) +
               Hex Data (256byte) + CRC (2bytes)
                   Response: 0x03 + address (3bytes) + CRC (2bytes)

   Program Control Flow is as follows:

(d) Verify that program stored in CPU - Follow sending the required command, the
command is sent again till correct response is received:


                Command: 0x04 + address (3bytes: Low, Mid, High byte in sequence)
             + CRC (2 bytes)
              Response: 0x04 + address (3bytes) + Hex Data (256) + CRC (2bytes)

       Verify Control Flow is as follows:




   (e) End CPU Writing/Work End – Following command and response are used:

               Command: 0x06 + CRC (2 bytes)
               Response: 0x06 + CRC (2 bytes)

   (f) CutOff – Following command and response are used:

               Command: 0x07 + CRC (2 bytes)
               Response: 0x07 + CRC (2 bytes)

   Step 5: User switches from AVR CPU writing Mode to AVR Normal Mode. User turns
   the power off and then turns power on again for this purpose.

Step 6: User switches from PC CPU Writing mode to PC REMOCON mode by clicking
REMOTE button at the screen box of PC CPU Writing.
